General Information
============

All master theses under my supervision are conducted following these guidelines:
- **Language:** The main language of the thesis is English.
- **Duration:** The typical duration of the thesis is 4 to 6 months when pursued full-time.
- **Literature Review:** Students should conduct a comprehensive literature review to establish a strong theoretical foundation for their research and demonstrate an understanding of relevant prior work in the field.
- **Data Collection:** When applicable, students must collect and process relevant data for their research.
- **Experimental Validation:** Experimental validation is a crucial aspect of the thesis. Students are expected to design, execute, and analyze experiments to test their hypotheses or validate their findings.
- **Regular Updates:** Students are encouraged to provide regular updates on their progress. This could involve  meetings, progress reports, or other forms of communication to ensure the research is on the right track.

Furthermore, each thesis should have a specific theme or task to investigate, that must be approved before the thesis work officially begins.
